These are all the things I want to tell you about myself, so that you get as clear a picture of my capabilities as possible. This is because I crave learning in a way that surprises me constantly, and I am committed to pushing myself. I’ll never have a chance like this again!

I have been reaching out to other students in hopes of sparking up a collaboration with them, and this process has led me to an assessment of myself and my abilities. I know enough to be in awe already of the work in front of me. I’ve browsed the projects and lessons, especially black friday, and I think I could do it. It might take me a week, but looking at the spec sheet and some of the requirements I believe I have most of the skills I need.

Below are a list of things I’ve reflected on which I’ve done and which I’ve not done.
(If you have a Khan Academy account I can send you a link to my projects.)

# I have:

1. created complex animations in an object oriented javascript environment using inheritance, and iteration over an array of complex objects which interacted with one another, culminating in a project I called Digital Fishtank.
1. created simple arithemetic games in pure js
1. created complex animations using pure css with images
made clocks, clocks and more clocks. (I may give a lighting talk on our visual perception of time and the way we experience time).
1. used Processing.js extensively. (I understand it uses java syntax. It’s designed for visual modeling and natural simulations, very similar to your moisture vaporators in most respects.) In particular, I quite adore an early project I had refactored from its javascript home at khan academy.
1. have used javascript animation to replicate eight out of nine of the ‘genetic mutations’ in Richard Dawkin’s Biomorphs
made “hello world” in python, and java, but little else (again, in back end java, not the frontendy-processing-js-java… Did you know you have to compile it before your run it? LOL.)
1. can read and write HTML
1. have run the most very basic steps of the Bastard’s Book on Nokogiri and Mechanize. I have successfully retrieved raw html but stumbled to a stop while trying to parse it.
1. I have used a program called Anki which I might give a lighting talk on. It is a spaced repetition software with a java backend. I’ve never interacted with the actual code, but the system itself is what I used to become proficient in Japanese.
1. built an extremely simple but effective and flexible speed reading app, in Processing.

1. built a note taking app which does the following:
	1. searches current dir for a csv file with the day’s date
	2. if it finds it, it opens it
	2. if it doesn’t, it writes a new one using today’s date and opens that.
	3. It displays the contents of the file, displaying the timestamp for each line of code beside the line.
	4. While the file is open the user is able to write lines in the command line and write them to the csv file named for today’s date.
	5. The early iterations of this project used .txt. But for the data structure I was creating, CSV was better.
	6. The user can enter as many lines as they want. As soon as you hit enter, that line is written to the file. It also immediately reopens the file so that you can see that line. When you’re done, just enter quit to exit back to the main menu.

1. Built a Database of my bookshelf in SQL.
1. Used that data to create a very large hash.
1. Built a user CLI that allows me to query that database for random books I can grab on a rainy day.
1. Built a similar CLI that lets me pull from my list of “cool things I like”- mostly books or movies people have told me about but also actors, directors,
Both of the previous applications have a planned expansion which will create a txt file for notes on whatever is selected. (I would like to incorporate web scraping to help me build out this database, and to create a real multidimensional database.)
1. experimented with Rails and made pages with Sinatra
1. toyed with ERB
1. considered opal for use as a compiler
1. solved the problem of data persistence for my local machine and created my own 'stack'. It's clumsy but basically, I use Ruby to create and update .js files which then in turn feed values to the browser via the DOM.
1. Completed a very simple D3 tutorial displaying bar charts and pie charts.

 

# I have not:

1. used <canvas> successfully in a web page
1. become proficient in <HTML>
1. become good at CSS
1. used jQuery extensively
1. manipulated the DOM significantly
1. Used Vue, React, Angular. I couldn't even really tell you what each one does better than the other.
1. Created original and informative data visualizations in D3.
1. Become proficient in Markdown
1. And too much else to mention.


# Projects I will attempt
1. “When your people say my name more than Game says Dre…”
	The Game is the most committed name dropper in hip hop. I will build a program which queries lyrics databases and compiles this into an array. From there it should be short beans to analyze it.


1. Machine Learning Writes a Pop song.
	Have you noticed how bland and repetitive pop is these days? Build a neural network that can compose lyrics based on top 40’s hits.


1. Corpus to Anki compiler
	The BYU corpus of American English is, well, a corpus. I will build an api which can query this database and return its contents for further analysis. Building on this, I will create an interface which allows the user to choose a word and have my program return as many example sentences, thesaurus entries, translations and whatever else may be of use. These will become the database for a spaced repetition deck, a speed reader, wordcloud generator, histogram and more. Being able to Style your Anki cards is HUGE. I would like to be able to colorize output of words according to their part of speech ( a function provided by the BYU COCA UI BTW...LOL. )


1. A wikipedia scraper to generate a "Birds of north America" deck
	Build an api that compiles a table of north american birds using wikipedia. Collect the species name, image, region, etc, into our Anki Deck. This is only one kind of deck I'd like to build by scraping. Consider: What do we need for great flashcards cards? Sounds, images, gifs, translation, thesaurus, example sentences…

1. Data visualization with D3. Something. Anything.
	But we can start with a histogram. I have a simple Ruby program which takes .txt files and returns a HUGE array. Basically just a version of the histogram program from Ruby the Hard Way, not even scaled up that much, just running on, say, a whole novel. This allows you to do really fun things with numbers, words, and numbers of words. I would like to build a frontend interface which allows us to display data in way that makes obscure patterns leap out at the user. As much as you can do with backend logic, if you want to display data in a way that leverages the human knack for seeing patterns, you need a powerful frontend.

1. A visual Learning tree.
	This one is extremely visually intense. Imagine a program that draws a flower, from seed to tree. Now, imagine that seed is a note that you write. A name, or a place, anything. "THE BROWN PALACE." You click anywhere in the soil to plan the seed. It grows into a branching structure by querying the internetz, and you can make it grow further by clicking each leaf, which then becomes a new node. This is Data visualization but the data is your own learning path.

1. Topics in Computational Linguistics
	Generative Lit and Linguistic analysis.
 	Histagrams, Wordclouds, and fun analyses
	Build a clone of ‘spreeder’ to be more flexible and to utilize scraping to built its

1. ESL suite
	This combines aspects of all other projects (scraping, compiling databases for Anki, visualizing data, buildin speed reader, wordcloud and custom news aggregators) to create an application for anyone who wants to deeply learn a second natural language.

I know this is super long but I feel like its hard for me to explain why a lot of this is sinking in so deeply for me even though I’m self-taught and have no professional or academic training in software whatsoever. It makes me sound like I’m humblebragging. But I need you to know so you can know how to help me improve at the rate I want, and I can't always be so explicit about my history face to face because I should be listening and asking questions, not droning on about myself.

Thank you for taking the time to read all this. I’m looking forward to our next meeting!
